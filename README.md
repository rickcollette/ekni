Enki is a god in Sumerian mythology who was worshipped as the god of wisdom, magic, and water. He was considered the patron deity of the city of Eridu and was said to have been the creator of humans and the one who brought civilization to the world. Enki was often depicted with the symbols of a goat and a fish, representing his association with both land and water. In some legends, he was also described as a trickster and a cunning deity who used his intelligence and wisdom to manipulate situations to his advantage. Despite his mischievous nature, Enki was revered as a powerful deity who had a significant impact on the lives of the ancient Sumerians.
